# Reddit Backend

This project has services for a web application similar to Reddit.

It was a group project for [CPSC 449][1] in Spring 2020. A group of three students, were assigned a role of either 'Dev', 'Test', or 'Ops'. After each major release, we took on a different role.

This project was initially implemented using Pythonâ€™s Flask framework. In this re-visit I'm implementing it in Go.
